# CSS Code of Conduct

Welcome to DePaul's Computer Science Society! This is a group by students, for students at DePaul who are interested in computing, computer science, or just technology in general. Alumni are welcome too!

The [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/cssdepaul/) page is where we share the majority of our event information. But if you have a @mail.depaul.edu email, please join our [Slack](https://depaul-css.slack.com/messages/D7ZUTSYAV/) as well.

These spaces are not just for us to post about our own events. We want to hear from all of you, events you've heard of, job postings you think everyone would be interested in, and memes you think the group would appreciate. This is a space for everyone.

## Rules and Guidelines

As a student organization, we are made up of a bunch of people of diverse backgrounds and opinions. In order to make this a welcome space for all, we have just a few rules and guidelines to ensure everyone is comfortable participating. If you think this needs to be edited or doesn't cover something important, please reach out to us at [cssdepaul@gmail.com](mailto:cssdepaul@gmail.com).

#### Rules

These are the rules. They are mostly common sense, but we feel that they are important to acknowledge. Breaking any of these rules will result in a prompt removal from the group and possible repercussions through DePaul being that this is a school organization.

* Absolutely no harassment, including personal attacks. Please see [DePaul's Anti-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment Policy](https://offices.depaul.edu/diversity/title-ix/Pages/discrimination-harassment.aspx) for what harassment is.
* No spam. This is a relatively large group and we want don't want to annoy our members. All posts must be tech related and pertain to the group as a whole.
* All job postings must be paid jobs or internships. We value the skillset of our membership and would like to see that they are compensated appropriately for the work they do. The exceptions to this rule are nonprofit, not-for-profit, and other organizations that rely on volunteers as well as start-ups that are entirely student run.

As a note, all posts in the group will be approved by an admin before it is posted. If the content in that post fails to comply with the code of conduct, we reserve the right to not approve your post.

## Inclusivity Statement

#### Computer Science Society is an all-inclusive community.

We encourage everyone to participate as much or as little in the community. We hope that people of all ages, genders, gender identities or expressions, cultures, ethnicities, languages, national origins, political beliefs, professions, races, religions, sexual orientations, socioeconomic statuses, and technical ability feel welcome in this space as we truly value all of your opinions and contributions to the group. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the characteristics above, including participants with disabilities.

#### Incident Reporting

If you have an issue with a member or post, please message one of the admins through a private Facebook message or email [cssdepaul@gmail.com](mailto:cssdepaul@gmail.com). If something makes you feel uncomfortable, we will do our best to moderate the situation. We will keep everything confidential, granted DePaul does have some conditions over when things need to be reported not anonymously (ie. someone is hurting you, you are hurting someone, you are hurting yourself).

## Acknowledgements
